    "title": "Fed Likely to Cut Rates Again in December",
    "details": "A Reuters poll shows most economists expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in December due to a weakening job market. This follows recent cuts amid stable but cooling employment data during the government shutdown. The move could stimulate economic growth but risks persistent inflation above the 2% target. Such policy hesitations reveal hypocrisies in balancing employment and price stability, emphasizing the need for economic self-reliance to avoid dependency on reactive monetary adjustments.",
