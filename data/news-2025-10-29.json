      "title": "Shutdown Puts SNAP Food Aid at Risk for 42 Million Americans",
      "summary": "Federal shutdown enters day 29, threatening SNAP benefits expiration for 42 million low-income families this week. Partisan gridlock over spending bills halts funding, exposing welfare system’s fragility amid inflation and immigrant influx straining resources. Consequences hit hardest: child hunger spikes, family stress mounts, local economies suffer from reduced spending. America First demands accountability—slash foreign aid like Israel’s blank check to protect citizens; mass deportations cut welfare burdens. Elites prioritize bureaucracy over babies. Borders secure families first.",
