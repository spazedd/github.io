      "summary": "Florida's 2nd District Court of Appeal reversed most of a $213.5 million jury award against Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital in the 'Take Care of Maya' case that inspired a Netflix documentary. The 2016 incident involved a hospital report of suspected medical child abuse for 10-year-old Maya Kowalski's high-dose ketamine treatment for pain syndrome, leading to her separation from mother Beata, who later suicided. The court ruled the hospital immune under Florida's good-faith reporter law for participating in dependency proceedings. This tragedy underscores how overzealous reports shatter families, imposing lifelong emotional and financial scars on innocents caught in bureaucracy. Immunity protects reporters but highlights need for evidence-based checks to prevent state overreach destroying parental bonds and prioritizing actual abuse over hunches.",

Bernad claims Sia hid a sedative-positive hospitalization and demands monitored visits plus massive child support. Sia counters with LAPD probe into Bernad's hard drive for illicit child pornography, limiting him to supervised access. This high-stakes feud exposes how celebrity splits weaponize grave claims, endangering toddlers amid investigations and sobriety battles. Families suffer when courts drag out custody wars, draining resources on legal fights instead of child stability.
