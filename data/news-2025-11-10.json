    "title": "Senate Compromise Advances End to US Government Shutdown",
    "details": "A bipartisan Senate deal cleared a key hurdle late Sunday to restore federal funding after the longest shutdown in history, funding government through January while addressing immediate crises. This comes amid Republican control pushing for efficiency but facing Democratic resistance over healthcare subsidies, reflecting national trends of fiscal gridlock post-elections. The shutdown furloughed workers, delayed SNAP benefits for millions of families, and caused over 2,000 daily flight cancellations, risking economic contraction and security lapses in air travel. Puts American workers and families first by cutting wasteful spending—finally prioritizing sovereignty over partisan games.",
