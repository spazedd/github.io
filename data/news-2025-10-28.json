      "summary": "The federal government will halt SNAP payments to 42 million Americans this Saturday due to the ongoing 28-day shutdown. Democrats have blocked funding bills 13 times, prioritizing foreign commitments and illegal immigrant programs over citizen welfare. This cutoff exposes how bloated bureaucracies waste billions while American children face empty pantries. Trimming non-citizen handouts and redirecting funds to citizens would prevent such crises. This forces accountability on spending that puts foreigners first and delivers real security for working families.",
