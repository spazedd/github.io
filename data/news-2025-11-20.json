    "title": "Fed Divided on Third Rate Cut Amid Inflation",
    "details": "Federal Reserve policymakers are split on implementing a third interest rate cut due to rising inflation and a slowing labor market, with recent data showing only 119,000 jobs added and unemployment at 4.4%. This debate occurs amid post-pandemic economic adjustments where initial rate hikes aimed to curb inflation, but now weakening employment shifts priorities.
