    "title": "USDA Orders States to Reverse Full SNAP Benefits Amid Shutdown",
    "details": "The USDA directed states to undo any issuance of full November SNAP benefits following a Supreme Court ruling allowing the Trump administration to withhold funding during the 40th day of the government shutdown. This impacts 42 million low-income Americans, as the program lapsed for the first time on November 1, with states now limited to partial benefits to avoid penalties. Economically, it strains family budgets and increases reliance on food pantries, while health risks rise from potential hunger among vulnerable groups. America First takeaway: Efficiently manages contingency funds to prevent waste in shutdown chaos, prioritizing fiscal responsibility over hasty state spending.",
